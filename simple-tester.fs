\ simple-tester is a unit tester intended for embedded systems or other hardware targets
\ based on the ANS Forth version of John Hayes' Forth ttester

\ the purpose of simple-tester is
\ (i)	to allow unit testing on targets with limited resources and
\ (ii)	to allow testing as early on as possible in the lifecycle of a new forth system,
\		even before the system knows how to compile new word defintions
\
\ simple-tester requires
\ (i)    a numeric output device (e.g. a seven-segment display)
\ (ii)   a system halt instruction
\ (iii ) the forth word DEPTH

\ The usage format has been changed from ttester with the hope/intention of being more "forth-like"
\ T{ module-of-code }T x1 x2 ... xn ==
\ T{ and }T brackets the code being tested
\ x1, x2, ... xn are the expected outputs
\ == is the assert instruction that performs the comparison and halts the system on the first fail
\ if a test either fails to complete execution or the actual and expected outputs do not match, then
\ the numeric output device will show the number of the test that failed

\ simple-tester uses a hash algorithm to compare inputs and outputs rather than cell by cell comparison
\ possible advantages
\ (i) 	2 cells only of RAM required for operation
\ (ii)	testing scope is limited only by stack depth
\ (iii) no stack gynmastics, easy to write the necessary code words in brief assembly language
\ (iv)	fast, advantageous for power-on-self-test-applications
\ disadvantage
\ (i)	false positive risk - hash collissions may allow a test to pass that should actually have been failed

\ the following words are expected to be available as code words on the target system, other words are utility words
\ Tstart Tend T{ T} ==

\ utility words called by the unit test code words
